Digital spectrometer workbench, works with any webcam or image/video uploads. This is a pre-alpha functional test.

See the live demo at https://fishscanner.com built directly from this repo using Netlify.

Perform spectral decomposition in your browser! Inspired by the [Theremino spectrometer tutorial](https://www.theremino.com/wp-content/uploads/files/Theremino_Spectrometer_Construction_ENG.pdf), with a much needed update using an accessible browser framework. You can use this to build your own.

To run:
`tinybuild`

Or `npm i -g tinybuild` then the above command.
